## Car Rental Application
This repository contains the source code for a car rental application, which is a software platform designed to streamline the process of renting vehicles for short periods.

### Objective
The objective of this project is to become familiar with the software development process by developing a web application for a Car Rental Application. Users can browse through vehicles that they want to rent and reserve them through the platform. Other features will be implemented to help facilitate the reservation process for the customers as well. Agile development (4 sprints) will be the software development methodology to implement the web application.
